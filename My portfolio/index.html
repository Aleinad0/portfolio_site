      <h2>Top 3 things that I'm great at:</h2>

      <h3>1. Coding üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª</h3>
      <p>
        Brights Academy turned me into a coding wizard‚ÄîI've got Python and SQL up my sleeve! Oh, and a sprinkle of HTML and CSS magic. This page you're admiring? Yup, crafted by yours truly!
      </p>

      <h3>2. Project management <span>üìù </span></h3>
      <p>
        <!-- I deeply enjoy the process of seeing things through while providing support to a team. 
        My years in travel retail allowed me to work with cross-functional teams in a fast-paced and international environment. -->
        I'm all about the thrill of steering projects to success while being the ultimate team cheerleader! My stint in travel retail was a wild ride, where I teamed up with rockstar groups in a turbo-charged, global setting.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Films <span> üé• </span></h3>
      <p>
        <!-- I love the film industry. Films and books raised me. It's how I learned English growing up and how I first saw the world. 
        Once I get on a plane I love visiting the iconic places I once saw at a movie theather.  -->
        Welcome to my cinematic universe! Movies and books were my childhood mentors, teaching me English and painting my worldview. Now, when I hop on a plane, I chase the celluloid dreams to real-world locations. Lights, camera, adventure!

      <h2> My School Projects </h2>
      <p> Welcome to my porfolio!</p> 
      <p> During my education at Brights I was part of two group projects. Here you can find some information about them 
        and links to my GIT repositories. 
      </p>
      <h3> ETL Pipeline for Daily Weather Data</h3>
      <p> We were asked to create an ETL project that would incluide extracting data from an API sorce and constructing a seamless pipeline for effficient data processing.</p>
      <p> For the project, we decided to use a weather station located at Bromma Airport in Stockholm to source the essential data. </p> 
      <p> Using Python code, not only did we interact with the API for data retrieval but also performed data cleansing operations before storing it in a database</p>
      <p>In this project, my key role within the team was to establish and guarantee the optimal functioning of AIRFLOW, adding a layer of orchestration to our data workflow.</p>
      <p>You can visit my repository with the code for the Mini ETL project </p>

        <h3> Solar Panels: ROIC Calculator</h3>

        <p> For our final project, we were asked to delved into sustainability, and develop a project that allinied with the UN's 2030 goals, with the tools we had learned during these 12 weeks.</p> 
        <p>Our focus? A web application designed to empower users in Sweden by providing estimates on the return on investment for solar panels based on their roof specifications and location.</p>

        <p>A cornerstone of our project was the commitment to reliable data. Leveraging an API from the European Commission, we obtained specific irradiation data for locations across Sweden. </p>
        <p>Taking it a step further, we applied Machine Learning to refine our model, enhancing the accuracy of electricity price projections over the next 30 years.</p>
          
        <p>In line with an agile methodology, I actively participated in gathering reliable data and contributed to our team's agile workflow.
        <p>My contribution extendedd also in crafting our dashboard using Dash, ensuring an intuitive and informative user interface, as well as designing our final presentation. </p></p>
